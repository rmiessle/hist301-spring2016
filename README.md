# HIST-301, Spring 2016
These files are part of the custom themes for the HIST-301 Spring 2016 course. The final project is available at [Uproar on Campus: Student Protests in the Vietnam War Era](http://hist-301.musselmanlibrary.org/peace/). Additional information about the build is available at the [Technical Information](http://hist-301.musselmanlibrary.org/peace/about/technical-information/) page of the site.

## WordPress
The main WordPress site uses a modified version of the [TwentyTwelve](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve/) theme as a child theme. Your WordPress site will need to have the TwentyTwelve theme installed, with these files placed in a twentytweleve-child folder in wp-content/themes.
## Omeka
For item display, the WordPress site embeds [Omeka](http://omeka.org) item pages within WordPress pages using the [Auto-iFrame plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-iframe/). The Omeka site uses a modified version of the [Omeka Starter Theme](https://github.com/InteractiveMechanics/omeka-starter-theme). The Omeka Starter Theme uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). [Featherlight.JS](http://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/) is the lightbox.
